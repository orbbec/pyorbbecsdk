# Linux Python SDK Compilation

This section provides a comprehensive guide to installing, compiling, and running the Orbbec SDK for Python, covering all necessary steps for setup.

<!-- TOC -->

- Contents:

  - Install Dependencies (Ubuntu)
  - Custom Python Path (Optional)
  - Build the Project
  - Run the Examples
  - Generate Python Stubs
  - Making a Python Wheel

Clone the repository to get the latest version:

```bash
git clone   https://github.com/orbbec/pyorbbecsdk.git
git checkout v2-main
```

## Install Dependencies (Ubuntu)

Install the necessary Python development packages

```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-dev python3-venv python3-pip python3-opencv
```

## Custom Python Path (Optional)

If you use Anaconda, update the Python path in `pyorbbecsdk/CMakeLists.txt` before the `find_package(Python3 REQUIRED COMPONENTS Interpreter Development)` line:

```bash
set(Python3_ROOT_DIR "/home/anaconda3/envs/py3.6.8") # Replace with your Python path
set(pybind11_DIR "${Python3_ROOT_DIR}/lib/python3.6/site-packages/pybind11/share/cmake/pybind11") # Replace with your Pybind11 path
```

## Build the Project

Create a virtual environment and build the project:

`````bash
cd pyorbbecsdk
python3 -m venv ./venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -Dpybind11_DIR=`pybind11-config --cmakedir` ..
make -j4
make install
`````

## Run the Examples

Set up the environment and run the examples:

```bash
cd pyorbbecsdk
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$(pwd)/install/lib/
sudo bash ./scripts/install_udev_rules.sh
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules && sudo udevadm trigger
python3 examples/depth_viewer.py
python3 examples/net_device.py # Requires ffmpeg installation for network devices
```

## Generate Python Stubs

Generate stubs for better IntelliSense support in your IDE

```bash
source env.sh
pip3 install pybind11-stubgen
pybind11-stubgen pyorbbecsdk
```

## Making a Python Wheel

To generate a wheel package for easy distribution

```bash
cd pyorbbecsdk
python3 -m venv ./venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -Dpybind11_DIR=`pybind11-config --cmakedir` ..
make -j4
make install
cd ..
pip3 install wheel
python3 setup.py bdist_wheel
pip3 install dist/*.whl
```

# Windows Python SDK Compilation

## Download the Python SDK Source Code

```python
git clone https://github.com/orbbec/pyorbbecsdk.git
```

## Install Dependencies

```python
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Here, it is assumed that you have installed Python 3 correctly. If you have not installed Python 3, you can refer to
the [Python official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and choose your Python 3 version for installation.

## Configure Visual Studio Project

* Open Cmake, set the source code path, and set the "build" folder as the path for generating binary files, as shown in
  the following figure.

* Click "Configure" and select the corresponding Visual Studio version and platform version. Then click "Finish", as
  shown below:
  ![Multi_camera1](../image/Win_Config_image2.png)
* Here, it is assumed that you have installed Cmake correctly. If you have not installed Cmake, you can refer to the Cmake official website for installation.

  Click "Generate", as shown below:
  ![Multi_camera1](../image/Win_Config_image3.png)

## Compile the Python SDK

    You can open the Python SDK project in two ways:

Method 1: Use Cmake, click the "Open Project" button, and open the Visual Studio project.

  Method 2: Use the file explorer to directly start the Visual Studio project in the build directory, as shown in the following figure:

  ![Multi_camera1](../image/Win_Config_image5.png)

  Open the Python SDK project, as shown below:

![Multi_camera1](../image/Win_Config_image6.png)

  Open the Python SDK project, as shown below:

![Multi_camera1](../image/Win_Config_image7.png)

  Right-click "INSTALL", as shown below:

![Multi_camera1](../image/Win_Config_image8.png)

  The compiled files will be copied to the install/lib directory, as shown below:
 ![Multi_camera1](../image/Win_Config_image9.png)

  Copy the files in the install/lib directory to the examples directory, as shown below:
  ![Multi_camera1](../image/Win_Config_image10.png)

## Test Examples

In the examples directory, execute test examples such as python ColorViewer.py, as shown below:
